Kimbi Bank Management Application
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Project: Kimbi Bank Management System
Course: INF 151 - Object-Oriented Programming with Java / Software Engineering
Institution: University of Yaoundé I
Date: December 18, 2025
Version: 1.0

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1.1 Purpose
-----------
This document describes the software requirements for the Kimbi Bank Management System, a simple Bank Management
Application developed as an academic project. The application demonstrates
fundamental Object-Oriented Programming concepts and basic software engineering
principles using Java.

1.2 Scope
---------
The Kimbi Bank Management Application is a console-based system that allows users to
perform basic banking operations. The system manages bank accounts and processes
transactions including deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and balance inquiries.

1.3 Intended Audience
---------------------
- Computer Science students learning Java and OOP concepts
- Course instructors evaluating OOP implementation
- Academic reviewers assessing software engineering practices

1.4 Project Objectives
----------------------
- Demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming principles (encapsulation, inheritance)
- Implement core banking functionalities in a simple, maintainable way
- Apply basic software engineering practices (documentation, testing)
- Create a working prototype suitable for academic presentation

2. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

2.1 Account Creation (FR-001)
-----------------------------
Description: The system shall allow users to create new bank accounts.
Input: Account holder's name
Output: Unique account number and confirmation message
Business Rules:
  - Each account must have a unique account number
  - Account number is auto-generated by the system
  - Initial balance is set to zero
  - Account holder name is mandatory

2.2 Money Withdrawal (FR-002)
-----------------------------
Description: The system shall allow account holders to withdraw money.
Input: Account number, withdrawal amount
Output: Updated balance and transaction confirmation
Business Rules:
  - Withdrawal amount must be positive
  - Account must have sufficient balance
  - Minimum balance of $0 must be maintained
  - Transaction is recorded in history

2.3 Money Transfer (FR-003)
---------------------------
Description: The system shall allow money transfer between accounts.
Input: Source account number, destination account number, transfer amount
Output: Updated balances for both accounts and confirmation
Business Rules:
  - Both accounts must exist in the system
  - Source account must have sufficient funds
  - Transfer amount must be positive
  - Transaction is recorded for both accounts

2.4 Deposit Functionality (FR-004)
----------------------------------
Description: Money transfer includes deposit capability (transfer to another account)
Input: Destination account number, deposit amount
Output: Updated balance and confirmation
Business Rules:
  - Deposit amount must be positive
  - Destination account must exist
  - Transaction is recorded in history

2.5 Balance Inquiry (FR-005)
----------------------------
Description: The system shall display current account balance.
Input: Account number
Output: Current balance amount
Business Rules:
  - Account must exist in the system
  - Balance is displayed in currency format

2.6 Transaction History (FR-006)
--------------------------------
Description: The system shall display all transactions for an account.
Input: Account number
Output: List of all transactions (date, type, amount)
Business Rules:
  - Displays transactions in chronological order
  - Shows transaction type (DEPOSIT, WITHDRAWAL, TRANSFER)
  - Includes transaction date and amount
  - Shows "No transactions yet" if history is empty
