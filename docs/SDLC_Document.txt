INTRODUCTION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

This document describes the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) followed
for the Kimbi Bank Management Application project. The SDLC is a structured approach
to software development that ensures quality, efficiency, and proper planning
throughout the entire development process.

The SDLC consists of six main phases:
1. Requirement Analysis
2. System Design
3. Implementation
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance

Each phase is explained in detail below with specific activities performed
for this project.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 1: REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Purpose:
--------
To understand what the system needs to do and document all requirements before
starting development.

Activities Performed:
--------------------
1. Problem Identification
   - Identified the need for a simple banking system demonstration
   - Recognized the educational goal: learn OOP concepts through practical application
   - Understood the academic constraints (time, individual work, presentation)

2. Stakeholder Analysis
   - Primary stakeholder: Course instructor (evaluates OOP and SE knowledge)
   - Secondary stakeholder: Student (learning and presenting)
   - End user: Demonstration audience (classmates)

3. Functional Requirements Gathering
   - Account creation functionality
   - Money withdrawal capability
   - Money transfer between accounts
   - Balance inquiry feature
   - Transaction history tracking
   - User-friendly menu system

4. Non-Functional Requirements
   - Console-based interface (no GUI required)
   - Simple and understandable code (beginner-friendly)
   - Proper OOP implementation (classes, objects, encapsulation)
   - Clear documentation and comments
   - Version control using Git/GitHub

5. Constraints Identified
   - Limited development time (urgent deadline)
   - Individual project (no team collaboration)
   - Must work on multiple computers (home and school)
   - No database (in-memory storage only)
   - Academic presentation requirement

Deliverables from This Phase:
-----------------------------
✓ Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Document
✓ List of functional and non-functional requirements
✓ Clear understanding of project scope and limitations


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 2: SYSTEM DESIGN
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Purpose:
--------
To plan the technical architecture and structure of the application before
writing any code.

Activities Performed:
--------------------
1. System Architecture Design
   - Decided on a layered architecture:
     * Presentation Layer: Main class with menu (user interaction)
     * Business Logic Layer: Bank class (manages operations)
     * Data Layer: Account and Transaction classes (data models)

2. Class Design (Object-Oriented Analysis)
   
   A. Transaction Class
      - Purpose: Represent a single banking transaction
      - Attributes:
        * transactionType (String): "DEPOSIT", "WITHDRAWAL", "TRANSFER"
        * amount (double): Money amount involved
        * date (String): When transaction occurred
      - Methods:
        * Constructor to initialize transaction
        * toString() to display transaction details
   
   B. Account Class
      - Purpose: Represent a bank account
      - Attributes:
        * accountNumber (String): Unique identifier
        * accountHolderName (String): Owner's name
        * balance (double): Current money in account
        * transactions (ArrayList<Transaction>): History of all transactions
      - Methods:
        * deposit(amount): Add money to account
        * withdraw(amount): Remove money from account
        * getBalance(): Return current balance
        * addTransaction(): Record a transaction
        * getTransactionHistory(): Display all transactions
   
   C. Bank Class
      - Purpose: Manage all accounts and operations
      - Attributes:
        * accounts (ArrayList<Account>): List of all bank accounts
        * accountCounter (int): Generate unique account numbers
      - Methods:
        * createAccount(name): Create new account
        * findAccount(accountNumber): Search for specific account
        * withdraw(accountNumber, amount): Process withdrawal
        * transfer(fromAccount, toAccount, amount): Process transfer
        * displayBalance(accountNumber): Show account balance
        * displayTransactionHistory(accountNumber): Show transaction list
   
   D. Main Class
      - Purpose: Program entry point and user interface
      - Responsibilities:
        * Display menu options
        * Get user input
        * Call appropriate Bank methods
        * Handle errors and display messages
        * Control program flow (loop until exit)

3. Data Flow Design
   User Input → Main.java → Bank.java → Account.java → Transaction.java
   Results ← Main.java ← Bank.java ← Account.java ← Transaction.java

4. Interface Design (Console Menu)
   ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
   │   BANK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM        │
   │                                 │
   │   1. Create Account             │
   │   2. Withdraw Money             │
   │   3. Transfer Money             │
   │   4. Check Balance              │
   │   5. View Transaction History   │
   │   6. Exit                       │
   │                                 │
   │   Enter your choice: _          │
   └─────────────────────────────────┘

5. Error Handling Strategy
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Check for sufficient balance before withdrawal
